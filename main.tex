\section{Introduction [2 pages]}

Spherical data is found in many applications.
% spherical data f: S^2 -> R, projection from R^3
Planetary data (such as meteorological or geological measurements) and brain activity are example of intrinsically spherical data.
The observation of the universe, LIDAR scans, and the digitalization of 3D objects are examples of projections due to observation.
See \figref{examples}.
In many applications, labels or variables are to be inferred from spherical data.
Examples are the inference of cosmological parameters from the distribution of mass in the universe \citep{perraudin2019deepspherecosmo}, the segmentation of omnidirectional images \citep{khasanova2017sphericalcnn}, and the segmentation of cyclones from Earth observation \citep{mudigonda2017climateevents}.

%	\item \textbf{Simplicity.}

%\end{enumerate}

% keep the story simple and focus on the tradeoff between cost (time / computational and storage / memory) and exactitude
As neural networks (NNs) have proved to be great tools for inference, variants have been developed to handle spherical data.
Exploiting the locally Euclidean property of the sphere, early attempts used standard 2D convolutions on a grid discretization of the sphere \citep{boomsma2017sphericalcnn, su2017sphericalcnn, coors2018sphericalcnn}.
While simple and efficient, those convolutions are not equivariant to rotations.
On the other side of this tradeoff, \citet{cohen2018sphericalcnn} and \citet{esteves2018sphericalcnn} proposed to perform proper spherical convolutions through the spherical harmonic transform.
While equivariant to rotations, those convolutions are expensive.

% On the one side, we have Cohen which is computationally very expensive but perfectly equivariant most general, on the other we have cube sphere which computationl very good but not equivariant at all. Other methods are tradedoff between these two. What is a good tradeoff? We think that DeepSphere is.

As the lack of equivariance penalizes performance (\secref{exp:cosmo}) and expensive convolutions prohibit their application to some real-world problems, methods standing between those two extremes are desired.
\citet{cohen2019gauge} proposed to reduce costs by limiting the size of the representation of the symmetry group.
% (from the continuous rotation group SO(3) to a discrete rotation group)
% the dimensionality of feature maps is equal to the size of the irreducible representation of the symmetry group
%As a platonic solid, it \todo{exhibits discrete rotations}.
% the representation of its symmetry group is much smaller than SO(3)
\todo{not all rotations, subset of SO(3)?}
The projection of the data from the sphere to the icosahedron however introduces distortions that might hinder performance (see the experiments in \secref{exp:climate}).
\todo{Where does Jiang fit? Need a global coordinate system (ok for planets, not projections like cosmo)}

Another approach represents the discretized sphere as a graph connecting pixels according to the distance between them \citep{bruna2013gnn, khasanova2017sphericalcnn, perraudin2019deepspherecosmo}.
While Laplacian-based graph convolutions are more efficient than spherical convolutions, they are not exactly equivariant \citep{defferrard2019deepsphereequiv}.
In this work, we argue that graph-based spherical CNNs strike an interesting balance, with a controllable tradeoff between cost and equivariance.
Experiments on multiple problems of practical interest show the competitiveness and flexibility of this approach.
% Furthermore, experiments show that, perhaps surprisingly and contrarily to previously published results \citep{cohen2019gauge} \todo{[Bronstein?]}, anisotropic filters might be an unnecessary price to pay.
% This paper focuses on improving the rotation equivariance of \citet{perraudin2019deepspherecosmo}, a scalable graph-based method designed for cosmological applications.

\section{Method [1 pages]}

The gist of the method is to define the spherical convolution using a graph, and the down-sampling operation using a hierarchical pixelisation of the sphere.

In their work they prove that the optimal weights solving the minimization problem (\ref{eq:minimization frossard}) are given by weights $w_{ij}$ inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between vertices:

% 	w_{ij} = \frac{1}{\norm{x_i-x_j}}

\section{Graph convolution and equivariance [2 pages]} \label{sec:equivariance}
%\section{Is graph convolution equivariant to rotation? [2 pages]} \label{sec:equivariance}

\subsection{Problem formulation}
% The plan for this section
% 0.1 Explain the sampling problem
As the graph convolution acts on a sampled version of the function $\b{f}$ and the rotation on its continuous counterpart $f$, a sampling operator is needed.
Given a sampling scheme $V=\{x_i\in\mathbb S^2, i=0, \dots, n\}$ of the sphere and a function $f : \mathbb S^2 \supset F_V \to \mathbb R$, the sampling operator $T_V: L^2(\mathbb S^2) \supset F\to \mathbb R^n,\  T_V(f) = \b{f}$ is defined as $\b{f}:\ f_i=f(x_i)$, where $F_V$ suitable subspace of $L^2(\mathbb S^2)$ such that $T_V$ is invertible, i.e., we can unambiguously reconstruct the function $f\in F_V$ from its sampled values $\b{f}$.
The existence of such subspace depends on the sampling scheme $V$, and its characterization is a common problem in signal processing (\cite{driscoll1994Fouriersphere}).
For most sampling schemes, it is not known if $F_V$ exist and hence if $T_V$ is invertible. A special case is the \textit{equiangular sampling} scheme where a sampling theorem holds, and thus we have a closed form of $T_V^{-1}$ is known. % \cite{driscoll1994Fouriersphere}
For sampling schemes where no such sampling formula is available, we leverage the discrete SHT to reconstruct $f$ from $\bf{f}$, thus approximating $T_V^{-1}$.
For all theoretical consideration, we assume that $F_V$ exists and $f \in F_V$.

% 0.2 Explain why the Laplacian is so important...
By definition, our (spherical) graph convolution is rotation equivariant, if and only if, it commutes with the rotation operator defined as $R(g), g\in SO(3)$: $R(g) f(x) = f\left(g^{-1} x \right)$.
In the context of this work, graph convolution is performed by recursive applications of the graph Laplacian, i.e: $h(\b{L}) \b{f} = \left(\sum_{i=0}^K \alpha_i \b{L}^i\right) \b{f}$\nati{Put this equation somewhere else?}.  Hence, if $\b{L}$ commutes with the rotation operator, then, by recursion, it will also commute with the convolution $h(\b{L})$.
As a result, to simplify our analysis, we concentrate on the graph Laplacian and $h(\b{L})$ is rotational invariant if and only if
% 0.3 Formulate the problem
\mart{Correct formula for equivariance error and the corresponding plots as soon as you changed it!}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:equivariance}
	\b{R}_V(g) \b{L} \b{f} = \b{L} \b{R}_V(g) \b{f} \hspace{1cm} \forall f\in F_V \text{ and } \forall g\in SO(3),
\end{equation}
where $\b{R}_V(g) = T_V R(g) T_V^{-1}$. For practical a evaluation of the equivariance, we define the \textit{normalized equivariance error} for a signal $\b{f}$, and a  rotation $g$ as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:equivariance error}
	E_{\b{L}}(\b{f}, g) = \left(\frac{ \norm {\b{R}_V(g) \b{L} \b{f} - \b{L} \b{R}_V(g) \b{f}} }{\norm {\b{L} \b{f}}}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
More generally for a class of signal $f \in C \subset F_V$, the \textit{mean equivariance error}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mean equivariance error}
	\overline E_{\b{L}, C} = \mathbb E_{\b{f}\in C, g\in SO(3)} \ E_{\b{L}}(\b{f}, g).
\end{equation}
\mart{Talk about the probability measure used on C, SO(3)?}
In practice, to analyze the equivariance error frequency,  the set $C$ we used is composed of functions $f$ made of spherical harmonic of a single degree $\ell$.
The expected value is obtained by averaging over a finite number of random functions and random rotations.

\subsection{Finding the optimal set of weights}
% !) summary the work of Khasanova -> No! to be put in section 2) Method
\cite{khasanova2017sphericalcnn} designed a Laplacian $\b{L}$ explicitly intended to work with the equiangular sampling.
They consider the set $\mathcal{G}$ of all the possible graphs where each node is connected only to four of its nearest neighbours (North, Sud, West, East) and propose a weighting scheme $w_{ij}$ that minimizes \eqref{eq:equivariance error} for specific rotations on the longitude latitude axis.
Their approach leads to weights $w_{ij}$ inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between vertices:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:frossard weights}
	w_{ij} = \frac{1}{\norm{x_i-x_j}}
\end{equation}

% 2) explain our approach
We chose a different approach and take inspiration from \cite{belkin2005towards}, which proves that for a random \emph{uniform sampling} scheme the graph Laplacian converges toward the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}$ as the number of sampling points goes to infinity.
This convergence result is important as a) $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}$ commutes with rotation ($\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}R(g) = R(g)\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}$) and b) is diagonalized by the spherical harmonics.
In this case the weighting scheme is full (every node is connected to every node) and is based on the exponential kernel:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:belkin_weights}
w_{ij} = e^{-\frac{1}{4t} \norm{x_i-x_j}^2}
\end{equation}
In practice most of the weights are very close to $0$ and hence, to optimize for computational efficiency, we limit ourselves to only the $k$ nearest neighbors. Given $k$, we find the optimal $t$, a grid search is performed using \eqref{eq:mean equivariance error}.


\subsection{Analysis of the proposed weighting scheme}
We analyse our proposed weighting scheme both theoretically and empirically.

\paragraph{Theoretical convergence.}
We extend the work of Belkin and Nyiogi to a sufficiently regular, deterministic sampling scheme. 
Given a sampling scheme $V = \{x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}\}$, define $\sigma_i$ to be the patch of the surface of the sphere corresponding to $x_i$, define $A_i$ to be its corresponding area and $d_i$ to be the radius of the smallest ball in $\mathbb R^3$ containing $\sigma_i$. Define $d^{(n)} := \max_{i=0, \dots, n}d_i$ and $A^{(n)}=\max_{i=0, \dots, n}A_i$.
\begin{theorem}
	For a sampling $V = \{x_i\in\mathbb S^2\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of the sphere that is equi-area and such that $d^{(n)} \leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$, for all $f: \mathbb S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ Lipschitz with respect to the Euclidean distance in $\mathbb R^3$, for all $y\in\mathbb S^2$, there exists a sequence $t_n = n^\beta$ such that the rescaled Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian $\frac{|\mathbb S^2|}{4\pi t_n^2}\b {L}^t_n$ converges pointwise to the Laplace Beltrami operator on the sphere $\Delta{\mathbb S^2}$  for $n\to\infty$:
	$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|\mathbb{S}^2|}{4\pi t_n^2} \b{L}_n^{t_n} f(x_i) =  \Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}f(x_i)\quad \forall i=0, ..., n-1.$$
	\label{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}
\end{theorem}
This theorem implies immediately that $\b{L}$ converges pointwisely toward an operator ($\Delta_{\mathbb S^2}$) commuting with rotation and hence is a strong hint for equivariance.
Importantly, the proof of Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling} in Appendix \ref{sec: appendix: proof of theorem} inspires us in the construction of our graph Laplacian. It gives us a strong hint how the parameter $t$ needs to be adjusted with respect to the number of points $n$.

It is important to keep in mind the limits of Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}.
First, it is \emph{not} a proof of equivariance of the graph convolution for a specific sampling. To construct such a proof, a stronger convergence result is needed, for example uniform convergence (instead of pointwise).
Unfortunately, the graph laplacian does \emph{not} converges uniformly in general \cite{belkin2007convergence}. This can probably be overcome by considering a specific class of functions, such as bandlimited function.
Second, while do not have a proof for it, we strongly believe that the HEALPix sampling does satisfy the hypothesis $d^{(n)}\leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$ of Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}. This is discussed in Appendix \ref{sec: appendix: proof of theorem}.


% 3) Show experimental results
\paragraph{Empirical convergence.}

% 3.0) explain how we obtained the figures
We calculated numerically the equivariance error (\ref{eq:mean equivariance error}) by generating $N$ monochromatic signals and $M$ random rotations for each signal. The colors that were used were chosen in the range $(0,\  3N_{side}-1)$ to allow for an almost perfect synthesis of the rotated signals, and thus an almost perfect implementation (up to numerical errors) of the operator $\b{R}_V$ (\cite{healpix_primer})

% 3.1) explain what the figures tell us
From 20\% error on V1, we got to less than 2\% error on V2. The number of neighbors used for V2 is $50$. More neighbors implies naturally more precision, plus a better kernel width obtained by "minimizing" the equivariance error. \mart{How to explain how we found the kernel width? Micha\"el I need your help here!!} Literally, minimizing the kernel width would lead to a completely disconnected graph. What we did was finding a heuristic law (fix neighbors, set the kernel width $\hat t$ by imposing the minimum weight to be equal to $0.1$) and then minimizing the equivariance error in the range $(\hat t / 10, \hat t\cdot 10) $. We got better that Khasanova-Frossard \mart{(check the code)} that however uses only 4 neighbors. However, it is built to explicitely minimize the equivariance error, so we expect it to be a good benchmark against which to test our construction.

The recognition of 3D shapes is a rotation invariant task: rotating an object doesn't change its nature.
While 3D shapes are usually represented as meshes or point clouds, representing them as spherical maps (\figref{depthmap}) naturally allows a rotation invariant treatment.
LIDAR actually acquires depth maps, which are a posteriori represented as point clouds.
\todo{move to intro?}

The SHREC'17 shape retrieval contest \citep{shrec17} contains 51,300 randomly oriented 3D models from ShapeNet \citep{shapenet}, to be classified in 55 categories (tables, lamps, airplanes, etc.).
As in \citet{cohen2018sphericalcnn}, objects are represented by 6 spherical maps.
At each pixel, a ray is traced towards the center of the sphere.
The distance from the sphere to the object forms a depth map.
The $\cos$ and $\sin$ of the surface angle forms two normal maps.
The same is done for the object's convex hull.
The maps are discretized using either an equiangular grid \citep{driscoll1994Fouriersphere} with bandwidth $b = 64$ ($N_{pix} = 4 b^2 = 16,384$), or an HEALPix \citep{healpix} grid with $N_{side} = 32$ ($N_{pix} = 12 N_{side}^2 = 12,288$).

As the information in those spherical maps resides in the low frequencies (\figref{spectrum}), reducing the equivariance error didn't translate into improved performance.
For the same reason, using the more uniform HEALPix discretization or lowering the resolution down to $N_{side} = 8$ didn't impact performance.

\subsection{Cosmological model classification} \label{sec:exp:cosmo}

Given observations, cosmologists estimate the posterior probability of cosmological parameters, such as the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the normalization of the matter power spectrum $\sigma_8$.
Those parameters are typically estimated by likelihood-free inference, which requires a function to predict the parameters from simulations.
% such as Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
As that is complicated to setup, prediction methods are typically benchmarked on the classification of spherical maps into cosmological model classes \citep{schmelze2017cosmologicalmodel}.
We used the same task, data, and setup as \citet{perraudin2019deepspherecosmo}: the classification of $720$ partial convergence maps ($1/12 \approx 8\%$ of the sphere) made of $10^6$ pixels from two $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models, ($\Omega_m = 0.31$, $\sigma_8 = 0.82)$ and ($\Omega_m = 0.26$, $\sigma_8 = 0.91)$, at a relative noise level of $4$.
% 60 maps * 12 parts = 720 parts
Convergence maps represent the distribution of over- and under-densities of mass in the universe \citep[see][for a review of gravitational lensing]{bartelman2010gravitationallensing}.

\subsection{Climate event segmentation} \label{sec:exp:climate}

We evaluate our method on a task proposed by \citep{mudigonda2017climateevents}: the segmentation of extreme climate events, Tropical Cyclones (TC) and Atmospheric Rivers (AR), in global climate simulations (\figref{examples:climate}).
The data was produced by a 20-year run of the Community Atmospheric Model v5 (CAM5) and consists of 16 channels such as temperature, wind, humidity, and pressure at multiple altitudes.
We used the pre-processed dataset from \citep{jiang2019sphericalcnn}.\footnote{Available at \url{http://island.me.berkeley.edu/ugscnn/data}.}

There is 1,072,805 spherical maps, down-sampled to a level-5 icosahedral grid ($N_{pix} = 10 \cdot 4^l + 2 = 10,242$).
The labels are heavily unbalanced with 0.1\% TC, 2.2\% AR, and 97.7\% background (BG) pixels.

DeepSphere achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting again that anisotropic filters are not necessary.

Compared to \citet{cohen2019gauge}'s conclusion, it is surprising that S2R does worse than DeepSphere (which is limited to S2S).
Potential explanations are (i) that their icosahedral projection introduces harmful distortions, or (ii) that a larger architecture can compensate for the lack of generality. % powerfulness?
We indeed observed that more feature maps and depth led to higher performance (\ref{sec:climate:appendix}).

\subsection{Uneven sampling} \label{sec:exp:ghcn}

To demonstrate the flexibility of modeling the discretized sphere by a graph, we collected historical measurements from about 10,000 weather stations scattered across the Earth.\footnote{\url{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description}}
The spherical data is heavily non-uniformly sampled, with a much higher density of weather stations over North America than the Pacific (\figref{examples:ghcn:tmax}).
For illustration, we devised two artificial tasks.
A dense regression that consists of predicting the temperature on a given day knowing the temperature on the 5 previous days.
A global regression that consists of predicting the day (represented as one period of a sine over the year) from temperature or precipitations.

Still, structure helps.

\section{Conclusion [0.5 pages]}

This work showed that DeepSphere strikes an interesting balance between desiderata for a spherical CNN.
A single parameter, the number of neighbors a pixel is connected to in the graph, controls the tradeoff between \todo{performance and efficiency}.
% vague words
As computational cost and memory consumption scales linearly with the number of pixels, DeepSphere easily deals with spherical maps made of millions of pixels.
Such high resolutions are not necessary to represent the depth maps of 3D objects, but are required to faithfully represent cosmological and climate data.
% That has to do with the frequency content of the signals (see fig xx)
% cannot do better
Also relevant in scientific applications is the flexibility offered by a graph representation to deal with partial coverage and non-uniform samplings.
% partial coverage / missing data
Finally, the implementation of Laplacian-based graph convolutions is straightforward.
The ubiquity of graph neural networks, pushing for a first-class support in Deep Learning frameworks, will make implementations even easier and more efficient.

A potential drawback of graph Laplacian-based approaches is that graph filters are isotropic, reducing the expressive power of the NN.
% in principle -> may in fact not
% Our experiments showed that DeepSphere nonetheless achieved state-of-the-art performance, on par with methods featuring anisotropic filters.
% didn't hurt perf in any experiment
% expressive power / generality / powerful / function approximator
%Why anisotropic filters?
Experiments from \citet{cohen2019gauge} suggest that more general convolutions achieve better performance.
Our climate experiments (\secref{exp:climate}) however show that DeepSphere achieves similar performance than their most general convolution.
% the SHREC17 experiment too shows that isotropic filters are sufficient
Works on shape alignment indicates that anisotropic filters achieve better performance \todo{[Bronstein]}.
Possible explanations for this discrepancy are that NNs somehow compensate for the lack of anisotropic filters, or that some tasks can be solved with isotropic filters.
% why: icosahedron, can do anisotropy with isotropy + non-linearity + pooling
The distortions induced by the icosahedral projection in \citep{cohen2019gauge} or the leakage of curvature information in \todo{[Bronstein]} might also be explanations.
Further research is needed to determine if anisotropic filters are an unnecessary price to pay or if they are needed for some applications.
% As was recently shown for graph NNs used for graph classification, most general might not be the best, when the ultimate goal is generalization [Andreas paper? + previous by xx]

Developing graph convolutions on irregular samplings that still respect the geometry of the sphere is another research direction of importance.
% known underlying manifold
Practitioners currently interpolate their measurements (coming from arbitrarily positioned weather stations, satellites or telescopes) to regular samplings.
This practice either results in a waste of precision or computational and storage resources.
Our ultimate goal is for practitioners to be able to work directly on their measurement, however distributed.

\section{Proof of theorem}\label{sec: appendix: proof of theorem}
Given a sampling $\{x_i\in\mathcal M\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of a closed, compact and infinitely differentiable manifold $\mathcal M$, a smooth function $f:\mathcal M \rightarrow \mathbb R$, and defined the vector $\b f$ of samples of $f$ as follows: $\b f\in \mathbb R^n,\ \b f_i = f(x_i)$, it is known that  (\cite{belkin2005towards}) to prove the convergence of $(\b {L}_n^t \b f) _i$ to $\Delta_{\mathbb S^2}f(x_i)$ it is sufficient to prove the convergence of its continuous counterpart $L_n^tf(x)$ to $\Delta_{\mathbb S^2}f(x)$
where $L_n^t$ is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}{}
	\label{def:Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator}
	\text{Given a sampling $\{x_i\in\mathcal M\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of the manifold we define the \textbf{operator} }$L_n^t$ such that
	$$L_n^tf(y) := \frac{1}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \exp \left\{ {-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}\right\}\left(f(y)-f(x_i)\right)\right]$$
\end{definition}
Thus, to prove theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling} it will be sufficient to prove that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuous convergence}
 \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|\mathbb{S}^2|}{4\pi t_n^2} {L}_n^{t_n} f(y) =  \Delta_{\mathbb{S}^2}f(y)
\end{equation}
For the sake of the proof we will need also the following facts:
\begin{definition}{} (\cite{belkin2005towards})\\ \label{eq: my L^t} Let $\mu$ be the uniform probability measure on the manifold $\mathcal M$, and let $\text{vol}(\mathcal M)$ be the volume of $\mathcal M$. We define the functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator to be the operator $L^t: L^{2}(\mathcal{M}) \rightarrow L^{2}(\mathcal{M})$ such that
	\label{def:Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator}
	$$ L^tf(y) = \int_{\mathcal M}\exp\left\{-\frac{||y-x||^2}{4t}\right\}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)d\mu(x)$$
\end{definition}

\begin{prop} (\cite{belkin2005towards}) \\
Let $\mathcal M$ be a $k$-dimensional compact smooth manifold embedded in some Euclidean space $\mathbb R^N$, and fix $y\in\mathcal M$. Let the data points $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be sampled form a uniform distribution on the manifold $\mathcal M$. Set $t_n=n^{-\frac{1}{k+2+\alpha}}$, for any $\alpha>0$ and let $f\in\mathcal C_\infty(\mathcal M)$. Then
	$$\frac{1}{t}\frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{k/2}} L^tf(y) \xrightarrow{t\to 0 } \frac{1}{\text{vol}(\mathcal M)}\triangle_{\mathcal M}f(y).$$
	\label{prop:3}
\end{prop}

% brief introduction:
This proof consists in two steps: first, we prove that $L_n^t \rightarrow L^t$, and second, we use proposition \ref{prop:3} to prove \eqref{eq:continuous convergence}. This equation, as already explained in \cite{belkin2007convergence}, directly implies theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}.

Our first goal is thus to prove the following Proposition:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:1}
	For an equal area sampling $\{x_i\in\mathbb S^2\}_{i=0}^{n-1}: A_i=A_j \forall i,j$ of the sphere it is true that for all $f: \mathbb S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ Lipschitz with respect to the Euclidean distance $||\cdot||$ with Lipschitz constant $\mathcal L_f$
	$$
	\left| \int_{\mathbb S^2}f({ x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_i f( x_i)\right|\leq \mathcal L_fd^{(n)}.
	$$
	Furthermore, for all $y\in\mathbb S^2$ the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator $L^t_n$ converges pointwise to the functional approximation of the Laplace Beltrami operator $L^t$
	$$ L_n^tf(y)\xrightarrow{n\to\infty} L^tf(y).$$
\end{prop}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{proof}

	Let us assume that the function $f:\mathbb R^3\rightarrow \mathbb R$ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $\mathcal L_f$, we have

	$$\left| \int_{\sigma_{i}}f({ x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}f( x_i)\right| \leq \mathcal L_fd^{(n)}\frac{1}{n} $$

	So, by triangular inequality and by summing all the contributions of all the $n$ patches
	$$\left| \int_{\mathbb S^2}f({ x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_i f( x_i)\right| \leq \sum_i \left| \int_{\sigma_{i}}f({ x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}f( x_i)\right|\leq n  \mathcal L_fd^{(n)}\frac{1}{n} = \mathcal L_fd^{(n)}$$
	Thanks to this result, we have the following two pointwise convergences

	$$\forall f \text{ Lipschiz,}\quad \forall y\in\mathbb S^2,  \quad\quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_i e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}\rightarrow \int e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}d\mu(x)$$
	$$\forall f \text{ Lipschiz,}\quad \forall y\in\mathbb S^2,  \quad\quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_i e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}f(x_i)\rightarrow \int e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}f(x)d\mu(x)$$

	Definitions \ref{def:Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator} and \ref{def:Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator} end the proof.
\end{proof}
\vspace{0.5cm}

Now, we just proved that \textit{keeping t fixed} $L_n^tf(x)\rightarrow L^tf(x)$. Now our goal is to prove that:

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:2}
	Given a sampling regular enough, i.e., for which we assume $A_i=A_j \ \forall i,j\text{ and }d^{(n)}\leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$, for a fixed $t>0$, a fixed Lipschitz function $f$ and a fixed point $y\in\mathbb S^2$ there exists a sequence $t_n = n^\beta, \beta<0$ such that
$$
\forall f \text{ Lipschitz, } \forall x\in\mathbb S^2 \quad \left|\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2}\left(L_n^{t_n}f(x) - L^{t_n}f(x)\right)\right|\xrightarrow{n\to \infty}0.
$$
\end{prop}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:2}]

We define for simplicity of notation
\begin{align}
	\phi^t(x;y) &:= e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)\\
	K^t(x,y) &:=  e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}
\end{align}
We start by writing the following chain of inequalities
\begin{align*}
	||L_n^tf-L^tf||_\infty &= \max _{y\in \mathbb S^2} \left|L_n^tf(y)-L^tf(y)\right|\\
	&= \max _{y\in \mathbb S^2} \left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^t(x_i; y)- \int_{\mathbb S^2} \phi^t(x;y)d\mu(x) \right|\\
	&\leq \max _{y\in \mathbb S^2}  \sum_{i=1}^n   \left| \frac{1}{n}  \phi^t(x_i; y)- \int_{\sigma_i} \phi^t(x;y)d\mu(x) \right|\\
	&\leq  \max _{y\in \mathbb S^2} \left[\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}d^{(n)} \right]\\
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}$ is the Lipschitz constant of $x \rightarrow \phi^t(x, y)$ and where we used for the last inequality Proposition \ref{prop:1}. If we assume $d^{(n)}\leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$ we have that

$$||L_n^tf-L^tf||_\infty  \leq  \max _{y\in \mathbb S^2} \left[ \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}} \right]$$

Let's now find the explicit dependence $t\rightarrow \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}$
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} &= ||\partial_x\phi^t(\cdot;y)||_\infty\\&
	= ||\partial_x\left(K^t(\cdot;y)f\right)||_\infty\\&
	= ||\partial_x K^t(\cdot;y)f + K^t(\cdot;y)\partial_x f||_\infty\\&
	\leq ||\partial_x K^t(\cdot;y)f||_\infty + ||K^t(\cdot;y)\partial_x f||_\infty\\&
	\leq  ||\partial_x K^t(\cdot;y)||_\infty||f||_\infty + ||K^t(\cdot;y)||_\infty||\partial_x f||_\infty\\&
	= ||\partial_x K^t(\cdot;y)||_\infty||f||_\infty + ||\partial_x f||_\infty\\&
	= \mathcal L_{K^t_y} ||f||_\infty + ||\partial_xf||_\infty\\&
	= \mathcal L_{K^t_y} ||f||_\infty + \mathcal L_f
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal L_{K^t_y}$ is the Lipschitz constant of $x\rightarrow K^t(x;y)$. We can observe that such constant does not depend on $y$:

$\mathcal L_{K^t_y} = \norm{\partial_x e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}_\infty = \norm{\frac{x}{2t}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}_\infty = \left. \frac{x}{2t}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}\right|_{x=\sqrt{2t}}=(2et)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\propto t ^ {-\frac{1}{2}}$

So we can continue
$$\begin{aligned}
	\max _{y\in \mathbb S^2} \left[  \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}} \right]
	&\leq  \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}} \left( (2et)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \norm{f}_\infty + \mathcal L_f \right)\\
	&\leq \frac{C\norm{f}_\infty}{\sqrt{n}(2et)^{1/2}} +   \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}\mathcal L_f\\
\end{aligned}$$
So we have that, rescaling by a factor $\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}$
\begin{align*}
	\norm{\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\left(L_n^tf-L^tf\right)}_\infty&\leq \frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\norm{\left(L_n^tf-L^tf\right)}_\infty \\
	&\leq \frac{C}{4\pi}\left[\frac{\norm{f}_\infty}{\sqrt{2e}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}t^{5/2}} + \frac{\mathcal L_f}{\sqrt{n}t^2}\right]
\end{align*}

we want $\begin{cases}
t \rightarrow 0\\
n \rightarrow \infty\\
\sqrt{n}t^{5/2} \rightarrow \infty\\
\sqrt{n}t^2 \rightarrow \infty
\end{cases}$ in order for $ \frac{C}{4\pi}\left[\frac{\norm{f}_\infty}{\sqrt{2e}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}t^{5/2}} + \frac{\mathcal L_f}{\sqrt{n}t^2}\right] \xrightarrow[t\to 0 ]{n\to\infty}0$

This is true if $\begin{cases}
t(n) = n^\beta, &\beta\in(-\frac{1}{5}, 0) \\
t(n) = n^\beta, &\beta\in(-\frac{1}{4}, 0)
\end{cases} \implies t(n) = n^\beta, \quad \beta\in(-\frac{1}{5}, 0)$

Indeed

$\sqrt{n}t^{5/2}=n^{5/2\beta+1/2}\xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \infty$ since $\frac{5}{2}\beta+1/2>0 \iff \beta>-\frac{1}{5}$

$\sqrt{n}t^2=n^{2\beta+1/2}\xrightarrow {N \to \infty} \infty$ since $2\beta+1/2>0 \iff \beta>-\frac{1}{4}$

So, for $t=n^\beta$ with $\beta\in(-\frac{1}{5}, 0)$ we have that

$$\begin{cases}
(t_n)\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\\
\norm{\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2}L_n^{t_n}f-\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2}L^{t_n}f}_\infty  \xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0
\end{cases}$$

\end{proof}


Theorem  \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}, is then an immediate consequence of Proposition \ref{prop:2} and Proposition \ref{prop:3}.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence for a regular sampling}]
	Thanks to Proposition \ref{prop:2} and Proposition \ref{prop:3}	we conclude that $\forall y\in\mathbb S^2 $
	$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2} L_n^{t_n}f(y) =  \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2} L^{t_n}f(y) = \frac{1}{|\mathbb S^2|}\triangle_{\mathbb S^2}f(y) $$
\end{proof}

The proof of this result is instructive since it shows that we need to impose some regularity conditions on the sampling. If the sampling is equal area as HEALPix, meaning that all the patches $\sigma_i$ have the same area, then we need to impose that $ d^{(n)}\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. \\
In the work of \cite{belkin2005towards} the sampling is drawn form a uniform random distribution on the sphere, and their proof heavily relies on the uniformity properties of the distribution from which the sampling is drawn. In our case the sampling is deterministic, and the fact that for a sphere there doesn't exist a regular sampling with more than 12 points (the vertices of a icosahedron) is indeed a problem that we need to overcome by imposing the regularity conditions above.

To conclude, we can see that the result obtained has the same form than the result obtained in \cite{belkin2005towards}. Given the kernel density $t(n)=n^\beta$, if Belkin et al. proved convergence in the random case for $\beta \in (-\frac{1}{4}, 0)$, we proved convergence in the deterministic case for $\beta \in (-\frac{1}{5}, 0)$. This kind of result can be interpreted in the following way. In order to have this pointwise convergence, we need to reduce the kernel width but \emph{not so fast} compared to the resolution of the graph. In other words, the kernel width has to be reduced but is somewhat limited by the resolution of the graph.

\subsubsection*{HEALPix}

HEALPix sampling, input signal at Nside = 32

CNN having 5 convolutional layers, a global average pooling layer and a fully-connected layer at the end, such as this:
\begin{dmath}
    [GC_{16}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside32}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{32}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside16}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{64}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside8}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{128}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside4}\, +\,\textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{256}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside2}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, GAP\, +\, FCN\, +\, \textrm{softmax}
\end{dmath}
Each convolutional layer has a graph convolution using Chebyshev polynomial approximation, batch normalization and ReLU activation. The order of the Chebyshev polynomial is 4 for each layer, the number of feature maps are [16, 32, 64, 128, 256] respectively and down-sampling to the immediate smaller resolution for each layer.

number of parameter: 190k TODO exact number?

batch size 32, adam optimizer, constant learning rate of $5 \cdot 10^{-2}$
cross-entropy loss, and add triplet loss from ``Esteves et al.''

30 epochs with augmented dataset, 3 random translation perturbation, or 90 epochs over dataset that can be augmented
\subsubsection*{Equiangular}
Equiangular sampling with bandwidth of 64 in longitude and latitude.
The architecture of the Neural Network is exactly the same, with a stride of [2, 2] for each pooling layer
\subsection{cosmo}

\begin{dmath}
    [GC_{16}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside1024}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{32}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside512}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{64}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside256}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{64}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside128}\, +\,\textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{64}\, +\, BN\, +\, ReLU]_{nside64}\, +\, \textrm{Pool}\, +\, [GC_{2}]_{nside32}\, +\, GAP\, +\, \textrm{softmax}
\end{dmath}

The order of the Chebyshev polynomial is 5 for each layer, the number of feature maps are [16, 32, 64, 64, 64, 3] respectively and down-sampling to the immediate smaller resolution for each layer.

batch size = 8, 80 epochs, adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss, learning rate $2\cdot10^{-4}\cdot0.999^{\textrm{step}}$

\subsection{Climate event segmentation} \label{sec:climate:appendix}

* Jiang rerun with a batch size of 64 instead of 256 due to memory limit.\\
* DS-jiang is the similar architecture as \cite{jiang2019sphericalcnn}. \\
* DS-optimal has 2 times the number of feature maps of DS. \\
* \todo{What is DS and DS-Cohen?} DS has 4 times more feature maps and one more layer than DS-Jiang. DS-optimal has still 2 times more feature maps. DS-Cohen should be mostly gauge (based on paper, no code): 4 times more feature maps, but 2 layers less than DS-Jiang. \\
* \todo{Is (equi non-weighted) the full resolution?} Yes, but less feature maps and layers. Can run, but not enough GPU memory for an optimal architecture. \\
* \todo{check column order for DS} \\
* perf with same arch as Jiang in appendix => not enough channels!\\
* even more feature maps give us one more point in perf\\

% trade off between AP and accuracy in the case of TC class, it seems.\\
% (full: we scale (50B pixels, 20TB) $\Rightarrow$ lead to better perf?)
% full dataset not enough memory to run a correct model
